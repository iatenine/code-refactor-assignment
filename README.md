## Description

I modified this codebase with the intent to increase its SEO ranking, accessibility and maintainability without impacting the designer's original vision

To improve SEO and accessibilty I modified several <div> tags to use more semantic labels including <header>, <footer>, <main>, <aside>, <nav> and multiple <section>'s while ensuring every <img> tag had an "alt" attribute

Maintainability changes were mostly confined to the css file, signficantly reducing total line count by combining classes with identical selectors and values into a single declaration block

Broken navbar link has also been fixed
